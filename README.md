# deterministic-LSH
Deterministic Locality Sensitive Hashing

Rough Plan
----------
Stage 0:
1. Setup `Makefile`

Stage 1: Core Implementation
1. Implement deterministic LSH with one basic test.
2. Implement classical LSH algorithm(s) with one basic test.
[3. Remember to update implementation section in final project report.]

Stage 2: Evaluation
1. Evaluate determistic LSH while varying parameters.
2. Evaluate classical LSH algorithm(s) while varying parameters.
[3. Remember to update evaluation section in final project report.]

Stage 3: Final Report
Final project due Dec 10
