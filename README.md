# deterministic-LSH
Deterministic Locality Sensitive Hashing

Rough Plan
----------
### Stage 0
* Setup `Makefile`

### Stage 1: Core Implementation
* Implement deterministic LSH with one basic test.
* Implement classical LSH algorithm(s) with one basic test.
* [Remember to update implementation section in final project report.]

### Stage 2: Evaluation
* Evaluate determistic LSH while varying parameters.
* Evaluate classical LSH algorithm(s) while varying parameters.
* [Remember to update evaluation section in final project report.]

### Stage 3: Final Report
Final project due Dec 10
